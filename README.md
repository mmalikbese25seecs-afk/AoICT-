 Assembly Reflections:
We noticed that using registers felt very different from using variables in Python. It was confusing because we had to remember which register stored what value. We found Assembly harder to read and write.
 Being a low level language is difficult for us to understand.
 We faced difficulty in understanding syntax of the language.
 
 #Python Reflections
 Using python to build same project was far easier than using assembly. We were easily able to code for a calculator. Loops and functions 
  helped us to code in an organized way.Thus python felt easier and faster to work with.

| Feature             | Assembly Example  | Python Example  | Notes                                                                 
| Variable Storage    | MOV AX, 5         |  x = 5          | Assembly uses registers for storage, Python uses named variables. |                                                                                 
| Printing Output     | INT 21h           | print("Hello")  | Printing in Assembly requires system calls, in Python itâ€™s a single print. |                                                                                                  
| Arithmetic          | ADD AX, BX        | x + y           |  In Python directly arithmetic operators are used, Assembly needs explicit                                                                   instructions. |
